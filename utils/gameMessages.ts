1. Conservative (10-20% yield, 10% risk)
   • Basic mineral extraction
   • Automated defense systems
   
2. Balanced (30-50% yield, 30% risk)
   • Advanced mining operations
   • Manual defense required
   
3. Aggressive (50-90% yield, 50% risk)
   • Deep core extraction
   • Combat likely required

BOUNTIES:
• [5000 XYLD] Eliminate hostile drone swarm
• [7500 XYLD] Secure processing facility
• [10000 XYLD] Investigate anomaly`

ARK DOCKING REGULATIONS:
- Profits can ONLY be withdrawn when Ark is docked
- Death during expedition results in TOTAL LOSS of generated yields
- Extraction MUST be completed before mission timer expires
- Failing to return to extraction zone will result in:
  • Loss of expedition yields
  • Partial loss of staked assets
  • Temporary lockout from future missions

REMEMBER: A successful explorer is a cautious explorer.
Stay alert. Stay alive. Return home.
